# TermPlanner

### Description
The TermPlanner app was created as the capstone project for the C971 Mobile App Development course at Western Governors University, utilizing Xamarin and C#.

In this project, you are tasked with developing a multi-screen mobile application that allows WGU students to manage their academic terms, the courses within those terms, and the assessments linked to each course. The app will enable students to add, modify, and remove information about terms, courses, and assessments. It will also provide both summary and detailed views of the courses for each term, deliver notifications for upcoming assessments, and alert students to important deadlines and milestones, even when the app is not actively running. Additionally, you will design a wireframe to serve as a basic visual representation of the app's layout. The application will operate using an SQLite database for data management.
